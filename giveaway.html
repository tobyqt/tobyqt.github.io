<h1 id="toc_0">Toby’s Game Giveaway</h1>

<p>I have a ton of un-redeemed Steam codes from all the Humble Bundles I’ve bought over the years. Some are for games I already have on Steam. Some are for games I own on another platform. Others are for games I’m not interested in playing. At least not when my list of “games I want to play” (as well as “books I want to read” and “TV shows I want to watch”) is already so long.</p>

<p>So I’m doing a giveaway. Look through the available games below, think about which ones you want, then <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/8ShZg7QdDffyTch03">go fill this form out</a>. An explanation of how the giveaway works is over there.</p>

<p>There are a lot of popular and well-reviewed games here. I left out a few games that had really bad reviews. I’m not trying to dump trash games onto my friends. But I did list some games with clear flaws (e.g. clunky controls) as long as they still had fans.</p>

<p>For now, I’m limiting the giveaway to people I know. But I’m defining that pretty broadly. If we’ve never really talked, but we’re mutuals on tumblr, or you’re in my Love Nikki association, that still counts as “I know you”. Just tell me how you know me in the giveaway entry form (e.g. “I’m username on tumblr and we’ve followed each other for ages”).</p>

<p>Now on to the games!</p>

<h1 id="toc_1"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/330820/2064_Read_Only_Memories/">2064: Read Only Memories</a></h1>

<h1 id="toc_2"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/330820/2064_Read_Only_Memories/"><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/330820/header.jpg" alt="2064: Read Only Memories"></a></h1>

<blockquote>
<p>2064: Read Only Memories is a cyberpunk thriller that explores the social challenges of tomorrow through classic adventure gaming. A journalist-turned-detective teams up with Turing, the world’s first sapient machine, to unmask a conspiracy that will shake the foundations of Neo-San Francisco.</p>

<h1 id="toc_3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/207650/A_Virus_Named_TOM/">A Virus Named TOM</a></h1>

<blockquote>
<p>A perfect place. A city without traffic. A dog that doesn&#39;t poop. All products of the brilliant mind of Dr. X, but hell hath no fury like a mad scientist fired by a giant corporation. In this unique action-puzzler you take control of TOM, a virus created for one purpose: revenge.</p>

<p>Hack your way through brain scrambling puzzles while maneuvering through a thumb cramping maze of enemies. Team up through over 50 cooperative levels in what MMGN is calling &quot;The most addictive co-op game we&#39;ve played since Portal 2.&quot; And if the over 100 levels aren&#39;t enough, you and your friends can destroy each other again and again in battle mode to determine just who is the supreme virus.</p>

<h1 id="toc_6"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/40400/AI_War_Fleet_Command/"><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/40400/header.jpg" alt="AI War: Fleet Command"></a></h1>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You are outgunned. You are massively outnumbered. You must win.&quot; These are your orders.</p>

<p>Humanity has already fought its war against the machines -- and lost. AI death squads stand watch over every planet and every wormhole, the few remaining human settlements are held captive in orbiting bubbles, and the AIs have turned their attention outward, away from the galaxy, to alien threats or opportunities unknown.</p>

<p>This inattention is our only hope: a small resistance, too insignificant even to be noticed by the AI central command, has survived. These are the forces you will command. The AI subcommanders will fight you to the death when they see you -- but your glimmer of opportunity comes from quietly subduing those subcommanders without alerting central processing to the danger until it&#39;s too late.</p>

<p>You do have a few things going in your favor. Your ships are much faster. You have safe AI routines to automate defenses and mining outposts. You have production techniques that can churn out fully-outfitted unmanned fighters in seconds. There will never be more than a few thousand of your ships versus tens of thousands of theirs, but through careful strategy you must somehow reach and destroy the heavily-guarded AI cores.</p>

<p>Go forth into the galaxy, steal AI technology, recapture those planets you must in order to achieve your ends, and save what remains of humanity. But draw too much attention to yourself, and the full might of the AI overlords will come crashing down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you&#39;re running on battery, make every second count!</p>

<p>Assault Android Cactus is an arcade style twin stick shooter set in a vivid sci fi universe. Junior Constable Cactus is outside her pay grade when she responds to a distress call and ends up stranded on a crippled space freighter under attack by its own robot workers.</p>

<p>Utilising a draining battery mechanic in place of lives, Assault Android Cactus challenges you to think fast and keep the bullets flying, blending the gameplay of western styled arena shooters with aspects of Japanese style bullet hell as you charge head first through transforming stages, massive boss battles and an eclectic cast of characters on the way to saving the day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When evil threatens the world, the world calls on Broforce - an under-funded, over-powered paramilitary organization dealing exclusively in excessive force. Brace your loins with up to four players to run ‘n’ gun as dozens of different bros and eliminate the opposing terrorist forces that threaten our way of life. Unleash scores of unique weapons and set off incredible chain reactions of fire, napalm, and limbs in the name of freedom. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chroma Squad is a tactical RPG about five stunt actors who decide to quit their jobs and start their own Power Rangers-inspired TV show! Cast actors, purchase equipment and upgrades for your studio, craft weapons and giant Mechas out of cardboard and duct tape.

<blockquote>
<p>The Escapists is a unique prison sandbox experience with lots of items to craft and combine in your daring quest for freedom. Life in prison will keep you on your toes with the strict rules that you’ll have to break. The guards are out to stop any escape attempts, so you’ll have to avoid suspicious behaviour by attending roll calls, working a prison job and hiding your stolen craftables. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their faces are the playing pieces. The rules are their emotions!</p>

<p>Ridiculously charming puzzles, wrapped around an epic tale of love and danger, topped off with an authentic old-time stringband soundtrack!</p>

<p>The goal is to put every one next to their friends.</p>

<p>But you can&#39;t please everybody all the time. Sometimes you gotta break hearts to save the day. And the day definitely needs saving: Volcanoes, exploding chickens, planetary invasion and a boy who just wants to dance with a girl.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The definitive version of the smash hit Metroidvania-style action-platformer, Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition adds new levels, powers, challenges and refinements to the sprawling, ridiculous, Mexican-inspired adventure of the original.</p>

<p>Carlos Calaca has kidnapped El Presidente&#39;s Daughter, and he plans to sacrifice her in order to merge the World of the Living with the World of the Dead.</p>

<p>Juan Aguacate, an agave farmer who stumbles upon a Legendary Luchador mask, must find the strength and courage to become the Hero he&#39;s always dreamed of being and put a stop to this.</p>

<p>Guacamelee! is a Metroidvania-style action-platformer set in a magical world inspired by traditional Mexican culture and folklore. The game features melee combat, parallel dimensions and same-screen co-op. The original Guacamelee! received wide critical acclaim and was a finalist for both IndieCade and the Independent Games Festival&#39;s Excellence in Visual Art award.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I also have a key for Guacamelee Gold Edition, which is apparently not quite as good as the Super Turbo Championship Edition. However, it does have a native Mac version. I can give the Gold Edition to a runner-up, or to a winner who prefers to have a native Mac version.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A virus, known as the Nanobyte has infected hardware around the globe rendering all systems useless - gaming is dead. The HoPiKo, who ran the games, have been enslaved... It’s time to hook up your power gloves and save your HoPiKo brothers!</p>

<p>HoPiKo is an intense speed run platformer where you get to save gaming. Jump from platform to platform avoiding death, exploiting shortcuts and ripping through 100s of hand-crafted levels, each one dropped into a 5-stage mini run designed to break your mind!</p>

<p>Compete to be the fastest in the world with time based scores, level pars and collectable retro consoles opening unique bonus runs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Program little office workers to solve puzzles. Be a good employee! The machines are coming... for your job.</p>

<p>Human Resource Machine is a puzzle game for nerds. In each level, your boss gives you a job. Automate it by programming your little office worker. If you succeed, you&#39;ll be promoted up to the next level for another year of work in the vast office building. Congratulations!</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry if you&#39;ve never programmed before - programming is just puzzle solving. If you strip away all the 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s and scary squiggly brackets, programming is actually really simple, logical, beautiful, and something that anyone can understand and have fun with! Are you already an expert? There will be extra challenges for you.</p>

<p>From the creators of World of Goo and Little Inferno. Have fun! Management is watching.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Mini Metro, you take on the task of designing the subway layout for a rapidly expanding city. Your city starts with three stations. Draw routes between these stations to connect them with subway lines. Commuters travel along your lines to get around the city as fast as they can. Each station can only hold a handful of waiting commuters so your subway network will need to be well-designed to avoid delays.</p>

<p>The city is growing. More stations are opening, and commuters are appearing faster. The demands on your network are ever-increasing. You&#39;ll be constantly redesigning your lines to maximise efficiency. The new assets you earn every week will help immensely — as long as they&#39;re used wisely.</p>

<p>Eventually your network will fail. Stations will open too quickly. Commuters will crowd the platforms. How long the city keeps moving is up to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tower of Guns is a fast paced first-person-shooter for the twitch gamer... with a few randomized elements to keep it fresh with each playthrough. It&#39;s a short burst &quot;Lunch Break FPS&quot;... not unlike Binding of Isaac mixed with Doom 2. Tower of Guns was made by a guy named Joe (with his brother Mike composing the music).</p>

<p>The game is designed not to artificially gate your progress. In VVVVVV there are no locks, no power-ups, no switches, nothing to stop you progressing except the challenges themselves.</p>

<p>Based on a true story, Western Press is the most historically accurate frontier dueling game available for PC and Mac. Probably. Competing in tournaments of up to 16 players (or bots), duelists both online and off will face each other in rapid fire, 1v1 sprints to finally settle who can press a random string of ten buttons the fastest.</p>

<p>World of Goo is a multiple award winning physics based puzzle / construction game made entirely by two guys. Drag and drop living, squirming, talking, globs of goo to build structures, bridges, cannonballs, zeppelins, and giant tongues. The millions of Goo Balls that live in the beautiful World of Goo are curious to explore - but they don&#39;t know that they are in a game, or that they are extremely delicious.</p>
